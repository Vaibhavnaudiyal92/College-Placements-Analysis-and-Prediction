# College-Placements-Analysis-and-Prediction
# Introduction

Almost each and every student has to go through placement process during the final year of their respective university courses. But what factors really affect the placement of a student? Is it their college degree percentage? School percentage? Performance in the entrance test of company? We will be studying about all these factors in the given notebook. Not only this, we will also be developing a predictive model to classify if a given student can get a placement or not.

# Data Sources
I have downloaded the dataset from [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com)
# Purpose
I will be analysing the factors that can affect the placement of an MBA student. Also, I will be creating a machine learning classifier model which will be able to predict of a given student can get a placement or not.

# NOTE
Size of dataset is very small(around 200-300 values). Performance will vary on increasing the size of dataset.

### Packages used
**sklearn, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn**
# Exploratory Data Analysis
Performed some analysis to better undertsand the data.

# Conclusion
With an average accuracy of 94%, Naive Baye's seems to be outperforming Decision Trees by 7%. After using SMOTE, we were able to obtain these better results. Why Naive Baye's? Because Naive Baye's performs well when the size of dataset is small.
